Change plan - this is just a note of all changes that will need to be made to the system.
Hopefully this will stop changes breaking the system in unexpected ways.

Changes to studentImpl - change the internship to a list of internships. 
Change the getter to return a list of internships, and the setter should 
just add a new internship to the list.

Changes to Admin - need to change approveOffer(). It currently takes a matric number,
but now that a student can have multiple internships it will also need an identifier 
for a specific advertisement. Similarly, when assigning an academic visitor we'll need a
way to identify which internship it is that we want to assign the visitor to.
