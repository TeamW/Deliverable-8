Change plan - this is just a note of all changes that will need to be made to the system.
Hopefully this will stop changes breaking the system in unexpected ways.

Changes to studentImpl - change the internship to a list of internships. 
Change the getter to return a list of internships, and the setter should 
just add a new internship to the list provided it meets the date criteria.

Changes to Admin - need to change approveOffer(). It currently takes a matric number,
but now that a student can have multiple internships it will also need an identifier 
for a specific advertisement. Similarly, when assigning an academic visitor we'll need a
way to identify which internship it is that we want to assign the visitor to. 
RecordVisitAssessment() also needs some identifier for a specific advert.

Issue with the use case in the documentation - the use case is viewStudentDetails, 
which is a command that the UI already has, but the main facade doesn't have a stub method 
for this. It is possible we're meant to add it in but that defeats the whole point of 
having a standardised facade for everyone. Maybe they forgot to add it in?
