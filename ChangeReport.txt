Change plan - this is just a note of all changes that will need to be made to the system.
Hopefully this will stop changes breaking the system in unexpected ways.

Changes to studentImpl - change the internship to a list of internships. 
Change the getter to return a list of internships, and the setter should 
just add a new internship to the list provided it meets the date criteria.
Student will also need a method to indicate whether they have a sufficient
number of weeks in the internships.

Changes to Admin - need to change approveOffer(). It currently takes a matric number,
but now that a student can have multiple internships it will also need an identifier 
for a specific internship. RecordVisitAssessment() also needs some identifier for 
a specific advert (Actually probably ignore this - "Other lower priority use cases may 
also change, such as the SHOULD HAVE RecordVisitAssessment use case. However you do 
not need to consider lower priority use cases.")

Issue with the use case in the documentation - the use case is viewStudentDetails, 
which is a command that the UI already has, but the main facade doesn't have a stub method 
for this. It is possible we're meant to add it in but that defeats the whole point of 
having a standardised facade for everyone. Maybe they forgot to add it in?

NOTE - since they're using the annoyingly out of date Date classes to find the number 
of days between Dates we can use this formula grabbed from stackOverFlow

final long DAY_IN_MILLIS = 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24;

int diffInDays = (int) ((date1.getTime() - date2.getTime())/ DAY_IN_MILLIS );

Actual changes made
Student now has appropriate getter for internships. Documentation updated.
StudentImpl now has list of internships, getter returns the list. Setter
checks if internships overlap, adds only if no.
